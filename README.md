# Data understanding is the second stage in CRISP-DM, the first being Business Understanding. 


Data understanding is the process of acquiring data, examining it for inconsistencies or gaps (loopholes), and gaining insight into its structure, content, and characteristics to assess its suitability for addressing the problem.


There are several steps to Data Understanding which are;

1. Acquiring Data: This can mean we get the data directly, from pre-existing data and big data sources.
2. After acquiring the data, we check its quality by identifying and resolving problems such as inconsistent data, duplicate entries, missing values, and outliers.
3. Explain the Data: Provide an overview of the data's structure, including its formats, data types, and number of rows and columns.
